# Senior Data Analyst 2026 Roadmap

This repository documents my structured 6-month journey to transition into a Senior Data Analyst role by 2026.

The focus is not just on tools — but on business-driven analytics, decision-making, and end-to-end ownership.

---

Objective

Build senior-level capability in:

- Advanced SQL (window functions, optimization, analytical tables)
- KPI design & business metrics thinking
- Power BI dashboards for executive decision-making
- Python for analytics & automation
- ETL/ELT pipelines
- Data modeling (fact/dimension, star schema)
- dbt & analytics engineering
- Airflow orchestration
- Interview readiness

---

Repository Structure

Each folder represents one week of focused learning and project implementation.

Every week includes:
- Business problem statement
- Dataset (real or simulated)
- SQL / Python scripts
- Dashboard file
- Insights & recommendations

---

Approach

Instead of only building dashboards, each project follows this flow:

Problem → Data → Analysis → Insight → Business Recommendation

The goal is to operate like a Senior Data Analyst — not just a report builder.
